# Logic Gate Sandbox: Web
> A logic gate sandbox.

## Play/Use
You can play with the sandbox at [http://lgsw.netlify.com/](http://lgsw.netlify.com/), while the development version can be found at [https://dev.lgsw.netlify.com/](https://dev.lgsw.netlify.com/).

You should learn at least some of the hotkeys to have a better experience. These can be found in [HOTKEYS.md](HOTKEYS.md).

## Inspiration
This is my adaptation of [Dave](https://davecode.me/)'s Logic Gate Sandbox (download available [here](https://davecode.me/userware)) with even more gates.
He actually has his own web version at [https://github.com/imdaveead/lgsw](https://github.com/imdaveead/lgsw).

## Roadmap
There are a couple of things I do want to add once I get the core mechanics down. These include:
- Better optimization of rendering.
- Adjustable clock alternations.
- More outputs (e.g. RGB lamp, sound generator, etc.).
